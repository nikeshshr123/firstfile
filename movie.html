        <b>Extraction </b>is a 2020 American action thriller film directed by Sam Hargrave (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Joe Russo, based on the graphic novel Ciudad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando León González, and Eric Skillman. The film's cast features Chris Hemsworth, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda (his international film debut), Golshifteh Farahani, Pankaj Tripathi and David Harbour. In the film, an Australian black ops mercenary takes on a mission to save an Indian drug lord's kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh, but the mission goes awry when he is double-crossed.

Announced to be in development on 2018, the film is a direct adaptation of the 2014 graphic novel as the Russo Brothers intended to bring the story to the screen. Several deviations separate the film from the source material of the graphic novel, however the overall story is largely maintained. Netflix released Extraction on April 24, 2020, where it received mixed reviews and became the most-watched original film in Netflix's history, with over 99 million viewers during the first four weeks.

A sequel titled Extraction 2 was released on June 16, 2023, with the main cast returning.
